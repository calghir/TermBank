# TermBank

TermBank is an application that allows users to store terms and definitions.
These terms and definitions are placed in unique categories so the user can quickly
access and view unique lists of terms and definitions!

# Functionality
* Add term - The user can add a term to their collection (e.g. a word you just learned from a book you're reading)
* Add definition - A definition will accompany each term added to a collection (e.g. a literal definition for a word you just learned)
* Create category - The user may create a category to associate certain terms with (History, Biology, Vocabulary, etc.)
* Choose category - The user can choose from existing categories they have already created to place the new term in

# Viewing
By default, the table of values will show terms and their definitions for **all** categories.
The user may specify a single category to view.
