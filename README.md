# TermBank

Hi, my name is Caleb, and I am building an independent project to hone my skills in Java, its many framworks,
and optimal programming designs. If you have any questions about this project, feel free to contact me.

# What is TermBank?
TermBank is a java application that allows users to store terms and definitions into a database.
These terms and definitions are placed in unique categories so the user can quickly
access and view unique lists of terms and definitions!

# Tools/APIs used:
* MySQL to safely maintain user's data
* Java Database Connectivity (JBDC) to query and inspect database information
* Java FX 13 to demonstrate visual modeling of data persistence
* Spring Boot (soon) to remove boilerplate code and simplify production


# Functionality
* Add term - The user can add a term to their collection (e.g. a word you just learned from a book you're reading)
* Add definition - A definition will accompany each term added to a collection (e.g. a literal definition for a word you just learned)
* Create category - The user may create a category to associate certain terms with (History, Biology, Vocabulary, etc.)
* Choose category - The user can choose from existing categories they have already created to place the new term in

# Viewing
By default, the table of values will show terms and their definitions for **all** categories.
The user may specify a single category to view.
